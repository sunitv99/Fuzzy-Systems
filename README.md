# Fuzzy-Systems
Problem definition: 

We have ideated a problem statement where we predict the Quality of Ice-Cream taking into consideration various parameters relating to it and using the Fuzzy Logic to simulate such an environment. Nowadays, neural network technique is also implemented in food engineering to reduce production cost and to estimate the quality of food products. Ice cream is a mixture of different flavors, proteins, milk, water and emulsifiers. To produce the acceptable quality of ice cream different ingredients are mixed under standard conditions of temperature and pressure. The quality of the ice cream depends on its viscosity, overrun, melting rate and firmness. All these factors affect the overall quality of the ice cream.Viscosity, overrun, melting rate and firmness have been taken as input parameters and the overall quality of the ice cream has been taken as output. Fuzzy systems can work with vague information and can explain how to make decisions but they cannot automatically generate rules they use for decision making.
